I am currently a third-year PhD student at Centre Borelli, ENS Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of Prof. [Nicolas Vayatis](http://nvayatis.perso.math.cnrs.fr) and [Ioannis Bargiotas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pI6eATYAAAAJ&hl=en). My main interests are nonparametric statistics, statistical learning and stochastic processes, with applications to biomedical studies. 

I work in collaboration with Prof. [Stephan Clémençon](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/clemenco/) at Télécom Paris on particular classes of stochastic processes with possible applications on statistical tests. 

Visit the [repository](https://github.com/MyrtoLimnios/covid19-biblio) and read the [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01450) of a selection of papers related to COVID-19 outbreak developed with Marie Garin, Alice Nicolaï and Nicolas Vayatis, with detailed reviews.

News: Accepted to the 16th edition of Women in Machine Learning Research Workshop @ NeurIPS 2021 !
