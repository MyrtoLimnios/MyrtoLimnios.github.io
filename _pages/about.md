I am a Bernoulli Instructor at the Institute of Mathematics at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/sb/research/math/research/statistics/). My research is centered on nonparametric statistics, statistical learning and stochastic processes, motivated by biomedical studies. 

I am interested in causal learning methods for event processes, using conditional local independence testing, in collaboration with [Niels Richard Hansen](https://nrhstat.org).

I work in collaboration with Prof. [Stephan Clémençon](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/clemenco/), Télécom Paris, on concentration results for particular classes of stochastic processes (k-sample Rank and U-processes) with applications to statistical tests in particular. 

I was a Postdoc at [Copenhagen Causality Lab](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/spt/cocala/) of the University of Copenhagen and worked with Niels Richard Hansen on learning methods for point processes. Prior to this, I successfully finished my PhD at Centre Borelli, ENS Paris-Saclay, Université Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of Prof. [Nicolas Vayatis](http://nvayatis.perso.math.cnrs.fr) and [Ioannis Bargiotas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pI6eATYAAAAJ&hl=en). My thesis entitled ''Rank Processes and Statistical Applications in High Dimension'' can be found [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03700901) and slides.
