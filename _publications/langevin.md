excerpt: 'Falls are a major concern of public health, particularly for older adults, as the consequences of falls include serious injuries and death. Therefore, the understanding and evaluation of postural control is considered key, as its deterioration is an important risk factor predisposing to falls. In this work we introduce a new Langevin-based model, local recall, that integrates the information from both the center of pressure (CoP) and the center of Mass (CoM) trajectories, and compare its accuracy to a previously proposed model that only uses the CoP. Nine healthy young participants were studied under quiet bipedal standing conditions with eyes either open or closed, while standing on either a rigid surface or a foam. We show that the local recall model produces significantly more accurate prediction than its counterpart, regardless of the eyes and surface conditions, and we replicate these results using another publicly available human dataset. Additionally, we show that parameters estimated using the local recall model are correlated with the quality of postural control, providing a promising method to evaluate static balance. These results suggest that this approach might be interesting to further extend our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of postural control in quiet stance.'
