excerpt: 'We review epidemiological models for the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic during the early months of the outbreak: 
from February to May 2020. The aim is to propose a methodological review that highlights the following characteristics: (i) the 
epidemic propagation models, (ii) the modeling of intervention strategies, (iii) the models and estimation procedures of the 
epidemic parameters and (iv) the characteristics of the data used. We finally selected 80 articles from open access databases 
based on criteria such as the theoretical background, the reproducibility, the incorporation of interventions strategies, etc. 
It mainly resulted to phenomenological, compartmental and individual-level models. A digital companion including an online sheet, 
a Kibana interface and a markdown document is proposed. Finally, this work provides an opportunity to witness how the scientific 
community reacted to this unique situation.'
