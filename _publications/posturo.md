excerpt: 'Falling in Parkinsonian syndromes (PS) is associated with postural instability and consists a common cause of disability among PS patients. Current posturographic practices record the body's center-of-pressure displacement (statokinesigram) while the patient stands on a force platform. Statokinesigrams, after appropriate signal processing, can offer numerous posturographic features, which however challenges the efforts for valid statistics via standard univariate approaches. In this work, we present the ts-AUC, a non-parametric multivariate two-sample test, which we employ to analyze statokinesigram differences among PS patients that are fallers (PSf) and non-fallers (PSNF). We included 123 PS patients who were classified into PSF or PSNF based on clinical assessment and underwent simple Romberg Test (eyes open/eyes closed). We analyzed posturographic features using both multiple testing with p-value adjustment and the ts-AUC. While the ts-AUC showed significant difference between groups (p-value = 0.01), multiple testing did not show any such difference. Interestingly, significant difference between the two groups was found only using the open-eyes protocol. PSF showed significantly increased antero-posterior movements as well as increased posturographic area, compared to PSNF. Our study demonstrates the superiority of the ts-AUC test compared to standard statistical tools in distinguishing PSF and PSNF in the multidimensional feature space. This result highlights more generally the fact that machine learning-based statistical tests can be seen as a natural extension of classical statistical approaches and should be considered, especially when dealing with multifactorial assessments.'

excerpt: 'Falls are a major concern of public health, particularly for older adults, as the consequences of falls include serious injuries and death. Therefore, the understanding and evaluation of postural control is considered key, as its deterioration is an important risk factor predisposing to falls. In this work we introduce a new Langevin-based model, local recall, that integrates the information from both the center of pressure (CoP) and the center of Mass (CoM) trajectories, and compare its accuracy to a previously proposed model that only uses the CoP. Nine healthy young participants were studied under quiet bipedal standing conditions with eyes either open or closed, while standing on either a rigid surface or a foam. We show that the local recall model produces significantly more accurate prediction than its counterpart, regardless of the eyes and surface conditions, and we replicate these results using another publicly available human dataset. Additionally, we show that parameters estimated using the local recall model are correlated with the quality of postural control, providing a promising method to evaluate static balance. These results suggest that this approach might be interesting to further extend our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of postural control in quiet stance.'
